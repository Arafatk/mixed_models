# mixed_models

Fit statistical linear models with fixed and mixed (random) effects in Ruby.

**Early stage work in progress.**

## Installation

<!-- Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mixed_models'
```
And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mixed_models -->

The development version of `mixed_models` can be installed using the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/agisga/mixed_models.git
cd mixed_models/
bundle install
bundle exec rake install
```

Ruby is required in version >=2.0 because keyword arguments are excessively used in `mixed_models`.

Feel free to contact me at alexej [dot] go [at] googlemail [dot] com, in case of difficulties with the installation.
